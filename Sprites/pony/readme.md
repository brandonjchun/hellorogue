Credit should be given to Kelvin Shadewing, preferably including a link to kelvinshadewing.net where possible. You are not required to release character sprites made with this base under the same license, unless the character themself is under a license that states otherwise.

## How to use

Open pony-body.png in any image editor that supports transparency. Open the other parts you wish to include and paste them over the body. Place the other part sheets over the body layer in this order:

* wing
* horn
* head
* body

From there, simply recolor and add your mane and tail as you please. Mane and tail bases will be made once all standard animations have been completed. Some animations are intended for unicorn/pegasus, and may look odd if used without the respective parts, but that doesn't mean you can't use them!

## Support

If you'd like to support the development and maintanance of this base, as well as the development of other species, consider joining my Patreon at https://patreon.com/kelvin, or sending a one-time donation to https://ko-fi.com/kelvinshadewing. If you would like your character made for you in this style, I will be opening commissions later to edit animations for you at 4$ per frame.
